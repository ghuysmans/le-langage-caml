# Le langage Caml
Examples are taken from the book
[_Le langage Caml_](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/books/llc.pdf), by
Pierre Weis and Xavier Leroy (InterEditions, 1993). Messages and
identifiers are in French and contain accented letters (ISO 8859-1
encoding). You'll need an 8-bit clean system to read them.
